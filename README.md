# Leaderboard-Study-Jam

This leaderboard is for the cloud enthusiastic students of Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College (JGEC) to help them understand their relative position in the cloud campaign.
It could act as a source of encouragement for them to learn and grow together; and explore more cloud technologies with peers as interested as them in this domain.
